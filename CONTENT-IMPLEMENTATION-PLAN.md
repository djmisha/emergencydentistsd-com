  metaTitle?: string; // Optional: allows custom meta title different from page title
  noindex?: boolean; // Optional: for pages that shouldn't be indexed
}
```

#### B. Implementation Strategy

**File:** `/src/layouts/Layout.astro`

**Changes Required:**

1. Extract and accept `description` prop
2. Allow optional `metaTitle` to override default title construction
3. Update the SEO component to use dynamic descriptions
4. Update OpenGraph tags with custom descriptions

**Modified Prop Handling:**

```typescript
const { title, description, metaTitle } = Astro.props;

const makeTitle = metaTitle
  ? metaTitle
  : title
  ? title + " | " + "Dr. Byers DDS"
  : "Dr. Byers DDS - 24/7 Emergency Dentist San Diego";

const makeDescription = description
  ? description
  : "Expert emergency and cosmetic dental care in San Diego. Dr. Byers DDS serves Kensington, North Park, and Normal Heights.";
```

### 2. FAQ Schema Implementation

**Required:** Structured data markup for all FAQ items to enable rich snippets in Google search results.

A persistent or severe toothache often signals a serious underlying issue, such as deep decay or an abscessed tooth. Immediate professional intervention is required because an abscess is a serious infection that can spread rapidly, potentially leading to significant health consequences. Dr. Byers offers prompt diagnosis, including oral exams and necessary X-rays, to determine the cause of the issue and administer immediate treatment.

Unlike standard emergency clinics, Dr. Byers is skilled at providing immediate restorative and cosmetic dentistry. This means the emergency treatment is not just temporary stabilization but often involves the initial steps toward high-quality, permanent aesthetic repair, leveraging his advanced skill set and in-house laboratory capabilities for optimal, swift results.

##### H3: Lost Restorations (Crowns, Fillings, Fixed Bridges)

#### H2: Step-by-Step Emergency First Aid Advice (Before You Arrive)

**Exact Content (Introduction):**

Taking proper action immediately after an injury can save a tooth or significantly reduce pain. Patients should initiate care by following these first aid protocols while en route to the office.

##### Specific Protocols for Common Dental Emergencies

**Exact Content:**

For a knocked-out permanent or adult tooth, it is crucial to keep the tooth moist at all times. Patients should attempt to place the tooth back in the socket without touching the root if possible, or store it in milk. If the tooth is dirty, it should be licked clean or rinsed gently in water. For severe toothaches, the mouth should be rinsed with warm water to clean the area out, and dental floss can be gently used to remove any trapped food debris. If the lip or tongue is bitten, a cold compress should be applied, and the area cleaned gently with water.

**Emergency First Aid Protocol Summary Table:**

| Emergency Scenario        | Immediate First Aid Instructions                                             | Reasoning for Urgency                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Knocked-Out Tooth (Adult) | Keep moist (saliva/milk). Try to reinsert into socket, holding by the crown. | Time is critical; increases the chance of successful reattachment.                   |
| Severe Toothache          | Rinse with warm water. Floss gently. Do not self-medicate topically.         | Pain signals infection (abscess) or decay requiring professional intervention.       |
| Lost Filling or Crown     | Preserve the piece. Avoid chewing. Protect exposed area with dental wax.     | Prevents infection and further structural damage to the sensitive core of the tooth. |

## Schema Implementation Guide

### 1. FAQ Schema (for FAQ Page)

**Implementation Location:** `/src/pages/faq.astro` - Add to page head after opening `<Layout>` tag

**Full Schema Template:**

```astro
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do I know if I need an emergency appointment?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If you are experiencing severe, persistent pain that cannot be managed; if you have uncontrollable bleeding; if there is significant swelling in the mouth or jaw; or if you have suffered trauma resulting in a knocked-out, fractured, or lost tooth/restoration. Immediate contact is vital to prevent severe complications, such as spreading infection."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the fastest way to get toothache relief before my appointment?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The most effective immediate action is to rinse your mouth thoroughly with warm water to clear the area. Gently use dental floss to ensure no food debris is trapped between teeth. Avoid placing aspirin directly on the gums, as this can cause tissue damage. Proper professional diagnosis from a dentist is the surest way to find lasting toothache relief."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What should I do with a knocked-out tooth?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If the tooth is permanent, find it and handle it only by the crown (the white visible part). If dirty, lick it clean or rinse gently, then attempt to re-insert it into the socket, holding it in place by biting down gently on gauze or a handkerchief. If re-insertion is impossible, store the tooth in milk or saliva and contact the office immediately."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Are emergency appointments available 24/7?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, Dr. Byers offers 24-hour emergency services, including availability on nights, weekends, and holidays. However, these services are strictly By Appointment Only. Patients must call (619) 282-7060 to schedule immediate access to care."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why is there a mandatory prepaid deposit for new emergency patients?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The required $850.00 deposit secures your immediate, unscheduled access to expert 24-hour care, ensuring that the necessary staff and resources are available to prioritize your urgent needs without administrative delay. This deposit is fully applied toward your total bill. Zero-interest financing is available for the remaining balance."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Which insurance plans do you accept?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We accept many major PPO plans; however, the practice is unable to accept Medi-Cal or Medicare. New patients should contact the office directly for verification of their specific insurance coverage."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the benefit of your In-House Lab?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The In-House Lab provides superior control over the fabrication process for customized restorations like crowns, veneers, and fixed bridges. This resource allows for faster turnaround times and immediate customization, ensuring that the final result is perfectly matched and fitted, expediting treatment completion for the patient."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How often should I have a dental exam and cleaning?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For most patients, an exam and cleaning every six months is recommended, but the frequency depends entirely on individual dental health conditions, which should be discussed with the dentist during your visit."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How can I improve my smile?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Smile improvement options range widely depending on individual needs. Dr. Byers can discuss aesthetic improvements ranging from professional teeth whitening and Invisalign to porcelain veneers and dental implants during a scheduled consultation."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What areas do you serve?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We proudly serve patients throughout San Diego County, including Kensington, North Park, Normal Heights, and surrounding communities."
