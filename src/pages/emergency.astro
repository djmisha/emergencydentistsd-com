        When Every Second Counts

        <p class="text-gray-900">
          A dental emergency is often unexpected and intensely painful,
          demanding immediate professional attention to avoid serious
          complications. Dr. Steven J. Byers DDS and his dedicated dental team
          understand the severity of these situations and have been serving
          emergency patients in San Diego, North Park, Kensington, and Normal
          Heights for years. With over 30 years of experience treating dental
          emergencies, the practice provides immediate relief from pain and
          infection, available 24 hours a day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and
          Holidays. Contacting the practice promptly in an emergency is vital to
          preventing further complications that can arise from traumatic
          injuries or spreading infections. Dr. Byers commits to getting
          patients out of dental pain as fast as possible with the least amount
          of discomfort.

          Common Dental Emergencies Treated

        <p class="text-gray-900">
          The practice is experienced in successfully treating any type of
          dental emergency, providing comprehensive care ranging from acute pain
          management to complex restorative procedures.

          Severe Tooth Pain, Abscess, and Infection Relief
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-900">
          A persistent or severe toothache often signals a serious underlying
          issue, such as deep decay or an abscessed tooth. Immediate
          professional intervention is required because an abscess is a serious
          infection that can spread rapidly, potentially leading to significant
          health consequences. Dr. Byers offers prompt diagnosis, including oral
          exams and necessary X-rays, to determine the cause of the issue and
          administer immediate treatment. Services provided include pain and
          infection relief, dental fillings for cavity treatment, and, when
          necessary, Root Canal Therapy. Root canal therapy is often required
          when an infection has reached the tooth's nerve.

          Knocked-Out Tooth (Avulsed Tooth) and Trauma Dentistry
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-900">
          A knocked-out tooth requires swift, specialized care. Dr. Byers is
          experienced in trauma dentistry, focusing on maximizing the chance of
          reattachment. When an adult tooth is involved, quick action within the
          first hour is crucial for successful outcomes. This expertise ensures
          that complex traumatic injuries are handled with the highest level of
          care.

          Fractured, Chipped, or Broken Teeth (Emergency Restoration)
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-900">
          Broken or chipped teeth, whether from trauma or biting into hard
          foods, are common and require prompt treatment to prevent exposure,
          preserve the tooth structure, and avoid infection. These cases often
          involve visible teeth, making aesthetic outcome a primary concern for
          the patient. Unlike standard emergency clinics, Dr. Byers is skilled
          at providing immediate restorative and cosmetic dentistry. This means
          the emergency treatment is not just temporary stabilization but often
          involves the initial steps toward high-quality, permanent aesthetic
          repair, leveraging his advanced skill set and in-house laboratory
          capabilities for optimal, swift results.

          Lost Restorations (Crowns, Fillings, Fixed Bridges)
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-900">
          Losing a crown or filling exposes the sensitive underlying dentin and
          increases the risk of sensitivity, pain, and infection. Dr. Byers and
          his team can quickly restore the lost filling or crown to protect the
          tooth structure and alleviate discomfort, ensuring the stability of
          the patient's existing dental work.

        <p class="text-gray-900">
          Due to the immediate, unscheduled nature of emergency care, a minimum
          deposit of $850.00 must be prepaid with cash or credit card for
          emergency dental services for new patients. This deposit secures
          immediate access to premium emergency services. The full deposit
          amount is applied directly to the patient's final bill. For the
          remaining balance, the practice offers convenient zero-interest
          financing options. Established patients of record receive care at
          their normal fee schedule.

          Step-by-Step Emergency First Aid Advice (Before You Arrive)
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-900">
          Taking proper action immediately after an injury can save a tooth or
          significantly reduce pain. Patients should initiate care by following
          these first aid protocols while en route to the office.

          Specific Protocols for Common Dental Emergencies
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-900">
          For a knocked-out permanent or adult tooth, it is crucial to keep the
          tooth moist at all times. Patients should attempt to place the tooth
          back in the socket without touching the root if possible, or store it
          in milk. If the tooth is dirty, it should be licked clean or rinsed
          gently in water. For severe toothaches, the mouth should be rinsed
          with warm water to clean the area out, and dental floss can be gently
          used to remove any trapped food debris. If the lip or tongue is
          bitten, a cold compress should be applied, and the area cleaned gently
          with water.
